The application is built on top of the Paranoia library, which is doing the real work (the Paranoia source is included in the cdparanoia source distribution). Like the original cdda2wav, cdparanoia package reads audio from the CDROM directly as data, with no analog step between, and writes the data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or raw 16 bit linear PCM. Cdparanoia is a bit different than most other CDDA extraction tools. It contains few-to-no 'extra' features, concentrating only on the ripping process and knowing as much as possible about the hardware performing it. Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid audio data from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, frame jitter and loss of streaming during atomic reads. Cdparanoia will also read and repair data from CDs that have been damaged in some way. At the same time, however, cdparanoia turns out to be easy to use and administrate. It has no compile time configuration, happily autodetecting the CDROM, its type, its interface and other aspects of the ripping process at runtime.

If you've always wanted to know exactly where your house is located without that annoying GPS wander, but didn't want to spend the money for a DGPS radio, here is your big chance! I'd like to announce a fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing but in reverse. The result is that you can receive the local DGPS corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the world's largest extension cord. You'll still need to be within 1000 miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 miles away. Several respondents from 2000 miles away have noted that the remote differential signals have diminished the SA-induced position and velocity errors by approximately 3 times.} maintainers nomaintainer categories comms version 1.32 revision 0

If you wanted to take advantage of Unicode in your application and support Windows 95/98 at the same time, your only option was to deploy two executables, one for NT and one for 9X. Fortunately, this changed in 2001 when MS (finally!) released MSLU runtime that allows Unicode applications to run under Windows 9X. Less fortunately, this solution requires that you use a special statically linked import library that decides at runtime whether to load symbols from system libraries like kernel32.dll or user32.dll (in case of Windows NT) or from unicows.dll (which provides Unicode emulation layer under 9X). This import library is only available for Microsoft Visual C++ and is only part of the new Platform SDK, which is rather huge package. libunicows contains independent implementation of the import library.

These relationships are expressed using URIs, most often URLs. Relying on URLs to directly identify resources to be retrieved often causes problems for end users. One way to avoid these problems is to use an entity resolver (a standard part of SAX) or a URI Resolver (a standard part of JAXP). A resolver can examine the URIs of the resources being requested and determine how best to satisfy those requests. The best way to make this function in an interoperable way is to define a standard format for mapping system identifiers and URIs. These {catalog  files} can be used to map public and system identifiers and other URIs to local files (or just other URIs). The XML Commons Resolver classes greatly simplify the task of using catalog files to perform entity resolution.} version 1.1 categories {java devel} revision 0

Furthermore, porting legacy C code to these languages or interfacing with legacy C libraries is a difficult and error-prone process.

GNU Prolog accepts Prolog+constraint programs and produces native binaries (like gcc does from a C source). The obtained executable is then stand-alone. The size of this executable can be quite small since GNU Prolog can avoid linking the code of most unused built-in predicates. The performance of GNU Prolog is very encouraging (comparable to commercial systems). Beside native-code compilation, GNU Prolog offers a classical interactive interpreter (top-level) with a debugger.} maintainers pmoura@mac.com categories lang version 1.3.0 revision 0

While the paper version remains the official standard, we think that in practice you'll find the Common Lisp HyperSpec much easier to navigate and use than its paper alternative.

SPA requires only a single encrypted packet in order to communicate various pieces of information including desired access through a Netfilter policy and/or complete commands to execute on the target system. By using Netfilter to maintain a 'default drop' stance, the main application of this program is to protect services such as OpenSSH with an additional layer of security in order to make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much more difficult. The authorization server passively monitors authorization packets via libcap and hence there is no 'server' to which to connect in the traditional sense. Access to a protected service is only granted after a valid encrypted and non-replayed packet is monitored.

This cipher is believed to provide very strong security. Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There is also a ccat command for decrypting a file directly to the terminal, thus reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext files around.

It can also use colors while displaying the logfiles (through regular expressions), for faster recognition of what is important and what not. It can also filter lines (again with regular expressions). It has interactive menus for editing given regular expressions and deleting and adding windows. One can also have windows with the output of shell scripts and other software. When viewing the output of external software, MultiTail can mimic the functionality of tools like 'watch' and such.}

The Zend Optimizer is distributed only in binary form as an Apache module that enables the server to serve optimized and obfuscated PHP code from third party vendors. Since the Optimizer is a binary module, it must run in a binary compatible OS and Apache environment. While newer versions of the Zend Optimizer do work with Apache 2.2.x, it appears that these binary modules are compiled on 10.4 and trying to load the module into Apache on 10.3 results in missing symbol errors. When older versions of the Zend Optimizer that work on 10.3 are loaded into Apache 2.2.x, then the error_log will contain messages about double free memory errors.
